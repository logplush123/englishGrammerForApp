        <h2 style="color: blue;"><u>Voice Transformation (Active to Passive)</u></h2>
        <p>We will explore the transformation of active sentences into passive voice across five categories.</p>
        <ol style="color: #2804f4; font-weight: bold;">
            <li>Tense</li>
            <li>Modal Verbs</li>
            <li>Let</li>
            <li>Imperative</li>
            <li>Infinitive</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In active sentences, the structure typically follows:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; -webkit-flow-into: inherit; color: rgb(127, 7, 239);"><b>Subject + Main Verb (Verb)
                + Object</b></p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>He is reading a book.</p>
        <p>The passive form of this sentence would be: "A book is being read by him."</p>
